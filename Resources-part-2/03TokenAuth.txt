TokenAuthentication

This authentication scheme uses a simple token-based HTTP authentication scheme.
Token authentication is appropriate for client-server setups,such as native desktop
and mobile clients.

To use the TokenAuthentication scheme you'll need to configure the authentication class
to include TokenAuthentication,and additionally include

rest_framework.authtoken in your installed_APPS setting.

installed_APPS = 'rest_framework.authtoken' ==> setting.py


Custom authentication


To implement  a Custom authentication scheme,subclass BaseAuthentication and override the 
authenticate(self,request) method.
