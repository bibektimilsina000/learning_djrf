Throttling

Throttling is similar to permission, in that it determines of a request should be authorized.
Throttles indicate a temporary state, and are used to control the rate of request that client
can make to an AIP.


You AIP might have a restrictive throttle for unauthenticated request, and a less restrictive throttle
for authenticated requests.

The Default throttling policy may be set globally,using the 

DEAFULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES and DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES settings.

For example:

REST_FRAMEWORK={
    'DEAFULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES':[
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
    ]
}

'DEAFULT_THROTTLE_RATES':{
    'anon':'100/day',
    'user':'100/day',
}



AnonRateThrottle ==> for anyonous user

UserRateThrottle ===> for user


ScopedRateTHrottle====> for specific part of AIP
